# Car-Price-Pridiction
Car Price Prediction is a Python-based machine learning project that predicts the selling price of used cars using Linear Regression, feature encoding, and data preprocessing.

🚗 Car Price Prediction (Python)

This project is a Car Price Prediction system built using Python and Machine Learning.
It predicts the selling price of a car based on features such as car name, fuel type, transmission, ownership, and more.

This project is beginner-friendly and ideal for learning:

Data preprocessing

Feature encoding

Machine learning pipelines

Model training and evaluation

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the selling price of used cars using a machine learning model.
We use a Linear Regression model with proper preprocessing techniques such as:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Splitting data into training and testing sets

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning

📂 Dataset

Dataset used: cardekho.csv

Contains information such as:

Car name

Year

Selling price

Fuel type

Transmission

Owner

Mileage

Engine

Max power

Seats

⚠️ Note:
Update the dataset path in the code if required.

⚙️ Project Workflow

Import required libraries

Load the dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Split data into training and testing sets

Build a machine learning pipeline

Train the Linear Regression model

Evaluate model performance

🤖 Machine Learning Model
